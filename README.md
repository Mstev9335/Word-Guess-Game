# Word-Guess-Game

Start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard.  If the letter you choose is in the word, the game fills 
the letter where it goes in the word.  If the letter you choose is not in the word, that letter is placed in
the "guessed" section and the amount of guesses you get is reduced by one.  When you have either correctly guessed all of
the letters in the word or you run out of guesses the game restarts with a new word.
